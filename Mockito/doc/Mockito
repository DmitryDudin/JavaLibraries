When Mockito creates a mock – it does so from the Class of an Type, not from an actual instance.
The mock simply creates a bare-bones shell instance of the Class, entirely instrumented to track
interactions with it.

On the other hand, the spy will wrap an existing instance. It will still behave in the same way as
the normal instance – the only difference is that it will also be instrumented to track all the
interactions with it.
